Inepta is a blast from the past: it's an OS written in vanilla Javascript that runs in Electron. I’m writing it to look back at the legacy ArcOS days, and to see exactly what's possible with just plain old vanilla Javascript in a modern browser. To my surprise, it's actually quite a lot. Inepta (which is Latin for 'silly', by the way) sports an actual Kernel with Kernel Modules like Process Management and Filesystem integration. Its UI is a mix of the ‘big 3’; Windows, Linux and MacOS. Everything about it is written in a simplistic and modular way to show beginner Javascript programmers (like my classmates) what's theoretically and practically possible in JS.
