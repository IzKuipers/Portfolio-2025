CanvasScript is a silly thing. I wanted to learn more about HTML canvases, and I figured the best way to accomplish that would be to create a project that incorporates them. So, I created CanvasScript. In CanvasScript you can write code to manipulate a canvas. It's got commands for lines, circles, colors, sizes, whatever you want. It's even got variables and comments to allow you to write the most readable and configurable code. It also has error checking to tell you on what line you're making a mistake. This is accomplished using Javascript exception handling.

CanvasScript doesn't use any normal standards for creating programming languages, it's really just a bunch of functions that have their arguments parsed out of a string for each row in the user's script. The functionality of CanvasScript can be tested using the test file on the GitHub repository, named "benchmark.canvas". This file can also be seen in action in the screenshot above. CanvasScript was intended to be a weekend project as well, which it thankfully stayed as.
