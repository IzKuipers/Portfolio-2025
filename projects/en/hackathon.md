In December 2024, I participated in the Digital Proof Hackathon at the Automotive Campus in Helmond with three team members. We were tasked with creating a user-friendly SPA dashboard to display approximately 70 columns of data in a clear and simplistic way for the users. For the frontend, we used Svelte and TypeScript, and for the backend, we used TypeScript with Express.js and SQL.

Due to privacy reasons, I cannot share specific information about the dashboard or the associated data. Therefore, I am unable to display the dashboard here. The best I can do is share a photo of the Audience Award, which we won with our dashboard.
