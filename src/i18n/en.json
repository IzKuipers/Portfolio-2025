Over the years I’ve pushed the limits of what’s possible with web technologies, even going as far as Web Operating Systems. In 2024 I started working on one of my biggest projects:",

I started experimenting with an old Windows XP machine at the age of 6, being programming away not a year later on my first 'modern' PC which I got when I turned 7. The first languages I took a crack at were Batch and VBS, eventually tackling HTML, CSS and Javascript. Over the years I’ve tackled everything from web operating system environments to API’s and embedded applications."
